The %{scl_name} package provides Apache Maven 3.5.0 with a set of Maven
plugins delivered as a Software Collection. For more information
about Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page.

Installing the %{scl_name} Software Collection gets you Maven 3.5.0
with all required dependencies, including the Java Development Kit.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'mvn'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications which
are not located in the file system root hierarchy but instead are stored in
an alternative location. The location is %{_scl_root} in
case of the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based
on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
information.

When you want to start working with the %{scl_name} Software Collection, use the
scl utility to enable the scl environment. See the scl(1) man page for
usage.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg from within the
  %{scl_name} Software Collection environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'mvn'
  Run mvn from the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} Software Collection
  enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man mvn'
  Show man pages for the mvn command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} Software Collection.
